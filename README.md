# Apple Quality Classification Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning course focused on classifying the quality of apples based on various features. The project explores different classification models, including a nearest neighbor baseline, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and ExtraTreeClassifier. The goal is to predict whether an apple is of "Good" or "Bad" quality, considering attributes like size, weight, sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, ripeness, and acidity.
