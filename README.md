# Machine Learning Project - Apple Quality Classification

## Introduction
This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on classifying apple quality. Three models—Nearest Neighbor Baseline, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and ExtraTree Classifier—are evaluated using the "Apple Quality" dataset from Kaggle.

## Files
- **main.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code.
- **apple_quality.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **README.md:** Project overview and instructions (you are reading it).

## How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/faris771/apple_quality_classifier.git
    cd apple-quality-classification
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open and run the `apple_quality_classification.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter. This can be done using Anaconda or any other Jupyter environment.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook apple_quality_classification.ipynb
    ```

4. **Explore the Code:**
    - The notebook contains sections for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and analysis.
    - Each cell is documented with comments explaining the code and its purpose.

5. **Experiment and Modify:**
    - Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, models, or dataset modifications.
    - Adjust parameters within the code and observe the impact on model performance.

6. **Contribute:**
    - If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contribute by opening an issue or creating a pull request.

## Dataset
- The "Apple Quality" dataset (AppleQuality.csv) is included for convenience.
- The dataset has been preprocessed for the purpose of this project.
